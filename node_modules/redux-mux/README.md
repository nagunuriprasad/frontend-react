# redux-mux

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/redux-mux.png?stars=true&downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/redux-mux/)


Redux abstraction for working with multiple redux stores.

`npm i -S redux-mux`

## Reason

When writing a redux library, there are sometimes use cases for using a separate store.  One use case for this is if your redux library dispatches frequently, it would be pretty rude to the consumer of the library.
