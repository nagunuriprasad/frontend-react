        Whether or not payment has been made, if the customer cancels within 72 hours for Single and Combo Pack Booking of the event, there is a 100% cancellation fee. For all event packages like Limited, Unlimited, Silver, Gold, and Diamond Packages, cancellation before 15 days from the event date will get a 100% refund. However, cancelation done after 15 days incurs a 30% cancellation fee.
